unodos instructions


unodos is a unique game which combines strategy, fast-thinking, and fun! In a rapidly evolving interface, your goal is to get the words 'UNO' or 'DOS' as many times possible before the board fills up... Every 3 seconds, a new random tile is added to the board. Watch out, everytime you succesfully gets 'UNO' or 'DOS', those three letters disappear and the pace at which tiles are added increases! Try to get as many 'UNO's and 'DOS's you can. 

Try to clear the board as fast as you can before it fills up! 


What's On Your Screen:

+ Above the board on the top left is your score. 

+ Above the board on the top right are the next five letters that are going to be added 
  to the board. The underlined letter is the one that's going to be generated next.

+ Under the board is the timer. It speeds up as you progress through the game.


How To Play:

In unodos, power is at the tip of your fingers... Move your mouse around the board and click on one of the 4 sides of a tile to move it. As your mouse hovers over one of those sides, its changes to a shade of grey.
